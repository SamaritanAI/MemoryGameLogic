# MemoryGameLogic

This programme will generate random numbers. The amount of numbers will vary depending on the difficulty the user has chosen:
1. Easy (Default) ==> 10 Digits
2. Medium ==> 20 Digits
3. Difficult ==> 30 Digits

The user will be given 2 minutes to memorise the digits and insert them sequentially going forward and backwards.
The user will get a point for each digits they get correct and a total of 80% is necessary to win.

This exercise is meant to develop one's memory by having them practice regularly.
More features will be implemented in the future.
